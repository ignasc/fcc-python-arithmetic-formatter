## Arithmetic Formatter in Python
### Sollution to freecodecamp [challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/arithmetic-formatter)

#### Notes:
This repository only contains the file which has the solution implemented. The remaining files, which are used for developing purposes, testing etc. are located in the link above, along with the description of the problem and requirements.

I have made a mistake of going through the basics of Python and then having more than a month pause before attempting to solve this problem, therefore I am certain there are methods in Python than could probably replace multiple lines of code used in my solution. The solution was writen using principles common to pretty much all programming languages (loops, function calls) and almost no use of Python specific features.
